/**
 * @file tokenizer.service.js
 * @description Placeholder service for token counting.
 * IMPORTANT: This service currently uses a VERY ROUGH ESTIMATION for token counting.
 * For accurate token counting, especially for managing LLM context windows effectively,
 * this should be replaced with a proper tokenizer library compatible with the specific
 * LLM model being used (e.g., Gemma, Llama).
 *
 * Recommended actions:
 * 1. Identify the exact LLM model family being used (e.g., from `ollama list`).
 * 2. Find a suitable JavaScript tokenizer library:
 *    - For OpenAI models (or models with compatible tokenization like some Llama variants): `tiktoken-node`
 *    - For Hugging Face models: Check if the `tokenizers` library (@huggingface/tokenizers) supports your model in Node.js.
 *    - Model-specific libraries: Some models might have their own dedicated tokenizers.
 * 3. Install the chosen library (e.g., `npm install tiktoken-node`).
 * 4. Update the `countTokens` method below to use the library.
 *
 * Using an inaccurate tokenizer can lead to:
 * - Exceeding the LLM's context window, causing errors or truncated responses.
 * - Inefficient use of the context window (e.g., including too few messages).
